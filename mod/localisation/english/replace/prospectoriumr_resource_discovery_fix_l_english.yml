 ResourceDiscovery1:0 "Just beneath the surface of [This.GetName] we found an dilapidated structure, hidden away by the passage of time. Though its framework remains somewhat intact, there is nothing worth salvaging inside the building itself. However, we have discovered a passage delving further underground."
 ResourceDiscovery2:0 "We found a group of smaller, bewildered machines at [This.GetName], still trying to execute their designated task. The machines were grouped together at a focal point blocked by debris and dismantled equipment. The main hub is offline and mostly useless, though a signal occurring at regular intervals and leading deeper underground has given us a clear direction to follow."
 ResourceDiscovery3:0 "Our early analysis of [This.GetName] uncovered a basic research center around a hole on the surface that led to a massive underground cavern. With the research center and its machinery entirely unsalvageable, we have refocused on surveying the cavern."
 ResourceDiscovery4:0 "After an exhaustive survey of the surface of [This.GetName] we discovered a probe that was engaged in an intensive scan of the region. No matter what we do or how we try to interfere, the probe will inevitably return to that one spot to continue its operations. Following its pattern of behavior, we have begun to survey the ground beneath."
 ResourceDiscovery5:0 "We have come across an old and ruined mining or research station at [This.GetName]. It seems likely that this crashed to the surface at some point in the past. It also shows signs of having been attacked. Despite the extensive damage, the station is continuing to direct a signal underground. Before moving on, we should no doubt investigate this further."
