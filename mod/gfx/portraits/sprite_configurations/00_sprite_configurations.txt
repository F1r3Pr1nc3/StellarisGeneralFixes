# Portrait sprite configurations allows to have conditional alternate visual effects for a portrait sprite.
# When trigger is passed, the portrait sprite is drawn with corresponding effect and masking texture.
# The trigger is estimated with leader, pop or species event scope
# (when called with species event scope, the 'from' subscope can contain a country species related to, when it is applicable)
# A portrait sprite defined in '.gfx' file that needs the ability to switch to alternate sprite configurations must contain
# 'alternate_configurations' list of the keys of such configurations, like:
# portraitType = {
#	...
#	alternate_configurations = {
#		holographic,
#		some_other_sprite_effect_configuration,
#		...
#	}
