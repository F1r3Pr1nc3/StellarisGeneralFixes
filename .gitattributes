# 1. Default Behavior
# Treat everything as text unless otherwise specified.
# Git will convert to LF on commit, and to CRLF on checkout (Windows).
* text=auto

# 2. Stellaris Script Files
# Explicitly mark these as text to avoid confusion.
*.txt text eol=crlf
*.gui text eol=crlf
*.gfx text eol=crlf
*.asset text eol=crlf
*.dlc text eol=crlf
*.mod text eol=lf

# 3. Localization Files
# These are sensitive. We force CRLF because some older Pdx tools
# get grumpy with pure LF, though the game is fine with either.
*.yml text eol=crlf
