# License and attribution

This repository aggregates fixes for a commercially released game. Many assets and original code are owned by the game's publisher (Paradox Development Studio) or by third-party mod authors. The mod is an unofficial patch and does not change ownership of original assets.

- Where possible the repository preserves or records original author credit in [Credits.md](Credits.md) and in per-change changelogs.
- If you reuse, adapt, or redistribute material from this repository or incorporated mods, please retain and, where practical, link to the original author/asset.
- This repository's maintainer appreciates attribution when changes are redistributed publicly, but it is not a legal requirement unless otherwise stated by the original author.

This repo is published alongside the Steam Workshop item: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3615026960

If you have specific licensing questions regarding a particular incorporated mod or asset, consult the original author's page (links are in [Credits.md](Credits.md)) or contact the maintainer via GitHub: https://github.com/F1r3Pr1nc3
